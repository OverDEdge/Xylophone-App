# Xylophone

## Description
A simple "music" app representing a "Xylophone" built in Flutter. On screen a number of colored 'tiles' can be seen. By pressing on the tiles a sound is played (similar to a xylophone).

App is based on the tutorial by LondonAppBrewery. Base for the app can be found here: https://github.com/londonappbrewery/xylophone-flutter
